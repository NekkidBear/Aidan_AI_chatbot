Implementing an interactive AI avatar using Python, Blender and GPT

This is a coding and artistic challenge to demonstrate and expand my skills.

The objective: Create an interactive character using Chat GPT, 3D modeling and python that will interact conversationally with the end user. He will listen to audio provided by the user, convert that audio to text, and then he will use that text as a GPT prompt. Then, using the GPT response, it will be converted using text-to-speech capability, and then output via audio, and animation, creating the illusion that you are conversing with a living character, rather than just typing a chat.

The 3D model is sculpted in Nomad and rigged for animation in Blender. I intend to use openAI's GPT engine, and other packages to create the interactivity.
